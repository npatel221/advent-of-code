## Day 1: Secret Entrance

**Time complexity:** O(n)
**Space complexity:** O(n)

### Approach
Brute-force approach to simulate the dial step by step.
- Part 1: Count when the dial stops at 0.
- Part 2: Count every time the dial passes 0 during rotation.


### Concepts
- Modular arithmetic for wrap-around.
- Step-wise simulation for accurate zero counting.
- Single Responsibility Principle.
- File I/O for command input.
- Simple Command struct to hold direction and magnitude.
